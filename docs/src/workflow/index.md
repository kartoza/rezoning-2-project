# # Workflow 
Development of REZoning 2 is documented on the [REZ Zoning 2 GitHub board](https://github.com/orgs/kartoza/projects/20) to acknowledge changes and work done to the platform. All developments of the platform are recorded in this format, most notably the conventions of adding features and the feature validation process.  
#  
## Overview 
The development workflow is run in sprints on the [GitHub board](https://github.com/orgs/kartoza/projects/20). When tickets have been created and allocated sprints are planned and executed to ensure major parts of the development are achieved when they are needed and development of the product remains on track. 

### The GitHub project board features 5 columns to monitor the workflow:

#### Backlog: 
This column features all the created tickets and is used to keep track of tasks that are still undone or still need to take place 

#### To-Do: 
From the Backlog, column tickets will be moved to the To-Do column by the developer to create a planned set of tasks to be worked on and completed within a certain timeframe. This is referred to as a sprint and usually contains a week to a month's worth of work.   

#### In-Progress: 
In progress is the work currently being worked on. When a developer starts working on a ticket it gets moved to the In-Progress column. This means other developers as well as team leaders can see what is currently being worked on and what still needs to be worked on. Unfinished tickets should also remain in this column. 

#### Done: 
When work on tickets has been completed and the developer has tested their work, the ticket is closed and moved to the done column. This column is a holder for tickets like the backlog column, where tickets can be internally tested. When a ticket fails internal testing, it should be opened with a comment and preferably a screenshot. The developer will be notified and should move the ticket to the relevant previous column for continued development. When a ticket passes internal testing, it can be closed with a comment and moved to the Passed Internal Testing column for client review.   

#### Passed Internal Testing: 
When tickets successfully passed internal testing, they can be closed with a comment and the ticket can be moved to the Passed Internal Testing column. From this column, the client can select and test tickets. If the client is satisfied with the result, they can move the ticket to the next column. If the client is not satisfied with the result of the ticket, they should reopen the ticket with a comment. This will notify the developer and they will move the ticket to the relevant column. 

#### Accepted By ESMAP: 
Tickets deemed finished by the client and require no further development or documentation are moved to the Accepted by ESMAP column.
